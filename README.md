# PigGame
Pig (dice) game using JS

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to "hold", their current score is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
